You are on an analytics team for A-Z Consulting and one of your new clients is a manufacturer of Tequila, 
Rum and Whiskey. You are assigned to this project and told that the client is considering expanding 
into a new market: Des Moines, Iowa, USA. They have hired A-Z Consulting to conduct the preparatory research prior 
to their possible expansion.


We know we have given you an open-ended task. Our goal is to better understand your decision making process. 
Therefore, we are more interested in how you arrive to your solution rather than the solution itself. 
There is no 'correct answer', but please make a case for your analysis/interpretation. 
That being said, we will evaluate you on your ability to guide us through your work, your story-telling / story-stitching, 
design and presentation skills. Should you hit a roadblock, please feel free to contact us

Choose any medium you are comfortable with for your presentation. We do not expect you to spend more 
than six hours on this task, so feel free to use tools that you are familiar/comfortable with. 
In the end, you will present your findings to us for fifteen minutes, followed by a discussion in our group.

You have access to the entire Iowa Liquor Sales hosted on a Google Cloud Bucket in CSV format. 
Data is provided as-is and has not been pre-processed for you.
